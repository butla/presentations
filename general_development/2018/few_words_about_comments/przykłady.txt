We don't need a real payload there. Besides, the actual shape
of the payload can get different over time, and since we're not
validating the payload in the API, it's probably best to leave
that impression in the tests.

Catching all psycopg2 errors so the Lambda won't be restarted
with the same events when an error type other than DataError pops up.

    Refactored Kinesis uploaders for predictable testing.

    Before they would just run in the background, even in unit tests.
    Now they are created outside of the application, so their test
    versions don't actually do anything in the background.

    events uploader: refactored background uploading

    Now it'll be easier to implement and test the precision of
    uploading the events once some capacity thresholds are reached.
